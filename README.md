# Library System

## Overview

The Library System is a terminal-based application built in C++ utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This system allows users to interact with a library by logging in, viewing available books, and managing book transactions such as borrowing and returning books.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Securely register and log in to access library functionalities.
- **View Available Books**: Browse a list of books available in the library.
- **Add a Book**: Add new books to the library's collection.
- **Borrow a Book**: Borrow books from the library.
- **Return a Book**: Return previously borrowed books.

## Components

- **User Class**: Manages user information and login credentials.
- **Book Class**: Handles book details and their availability status.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Program** (if needed):
   ```bash
   g++ -o library_system main.cpp user.cpp book.cpp
   ```

2. **Run the Main File**:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

3. **Follow the On-Screen Prompts** to register, log in, view books, and manage book transactions.

## Directory Structure

- `main.cpp` - The entry point of the application.
- `user.cpp` - Contains the implementation of the User class.
- `book.cpp` - Contains the implementation of the Book class.
- `user.h` - Header file for the User class.
- `book.h` - Header file for the Book class.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Terminal or command prompt
